# Graphical-python-drawing
This project serves as a foundation for drawing graphical elements in Python using the Pygame library. The current version includes a **point** class, representing a point with adjustable color and position on the screen. The point can be drawn, erased, and have its color changed based on user input via the keyboard.

## Features
Point Drawing: Allows drawing a point on the screen at a defined color and position.
Color Adjustment: Ability to add RGB values to the current color of the point.
Interactive Controls: The point can be moved with a mouse click, and its color can be changed with key presses.
## Planned Enhancements
Adding additional shapes, such as circles, squares, and lines.
Ability to dynamically change shape sizes and transparency.
Expanding interactive control options and real-time parameter adjustments.
## Usage
To run the application, you need to have [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) installed. Simply launch the **main()** script and control the program as described (e.g., using the **Q**, **W**, and **E** keys to change the point's color).
